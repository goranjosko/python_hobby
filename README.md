# python_hobby repository

**List of my hobby projects, scripts, GUI elements, algorithms, etc.**

<p>**Note!** *Awfully messy code, python amateur programmer!*</p> 
<p>These are not commercial projects, nor are they of any commercial value / they represent my hobby. 
Instead of solving sudoku, I realized that it was more interesting to learn how to solve problems using python. 
I still don't know how to use GitHUb properly.</p>
